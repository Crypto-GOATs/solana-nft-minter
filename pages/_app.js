BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL LOSS OF TEST DATA AND ASSETS.

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using the services provided by SolanaOnlyFans (referred to as "We," "Us," or "Our") through the SolanaOnlyFans Devnet Marketplace ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

**The primary purpose of the Service is to facilitate testing, development, and debugging of decentralized applications. It is not intended for commercial use.**

## 2. Devnet & Experimental Status Disclaimers

### 2.1. NO MONETARY VALUE

1. **Test Tokens Only:** All transactions on the Service use tokens (SOL and NFTs) obtained from the Solana Devnet faucet. These tokens are for testing purposes only and **possess zero (0) economic or financial value**.

2. **No Financial Liability:** We are not responsible for, and you will not have any claim against us for, any purported monetary loss, capital gain, tax liability, or financial damages arising from the use of, loss of, or changes to any Devnet assets.

3. **No Future Guarantee:** Your participation in the Devnet does not entitle you to any future compensation, airdrops, ownership, or rights on the Solana Mainnet, Testnet, or any future production environment.

### 2.2. SOFTWARE AS-IS & NO WARRANTY

The Service is provided on an **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** basis. We make no guarantees regarding its functionality, security, or availability. You acknowledge and agree that:

* The Service may contain bugs, errors, or security vulnerabilities.

* Any data, smart contracts, or tokens deployed or stored on Devnet may be permanently deleted or lost without recovery.

## 3. User Accounts and Access

### 3.1. Eligibility

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction.

### 3.2. Wallet Connection

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Solana wallet and private keys used to access the Service. We do not store or control your private keys and cannot recover access to your wallet. You acknowledge that if your Devnet wallet is compromised, we bear no responsibility.

## 4. User Conduct and Content (Intellectual Property)
